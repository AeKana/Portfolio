# Million Song Dataset
The Million Songs Collection is a collection of 28 datasets containing audio features and metadata for a million contemporary popular music tracks. However, I used a smaller subset consisting of 10,000 songs. 

Due to the large dataset I am unable to upload it here, but it can be downloaded here.
