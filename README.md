# Arthur Cheng's Portfolio
A collection of projects dedicated in learning, exploring, and demonstrating my understanding of data analysis using various programming languages.

### Why are you learning programming and data analysis?
Programming is a skill I think most people should learn in practicing problem solving skills through coding in any field; however, I will discusss why I'm learning coding in Psychology as that is my field of study. 

In particular, the data collection phase in most modern psychological research studies has largely become computerised, thus many of the methods and tasks used to collect data are created using software through graphical user interface (GUI). Furthermore, programming languages can offer both graphical and statistical analysis of data, making it a popular choice when it comes to presenting and visualizing data results.
