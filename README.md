# Arthur Cheng's Portfolio
A collection of projects dedicated in learning, exploring, and demonstrating my understanding of data analysis using various programming languages.

### Why are you learning programming and data analysis?
Programming is a skill I think most people should learn in practicing problem solving skills through code especially as a psychology graduate like myself. 

In particular, the data collection phase in most modern psychological research has largely become computerised, thus many of the methods and tasks used to collect data are created using software. Furthermore, programming languages can offer both graphical and statistical analysis of data, making it a popular choice when it comes to presenting and visualization data results.
